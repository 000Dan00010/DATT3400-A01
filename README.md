Throughout this project, I started with the idea of creating an ecosystem, similar to how bacteria interact with each other in a petri dish, by consuming or simply interacting with each other, as shown in the first and second images. However, I realized that the variables might not interact properly, so I pursued a new idea that mimicked the behavior of large swarms of fish, how they swim and interact with each other and then get hunted and consumed by various predators. This concept was inspired by the third and fourth images, and I have depicted my idea in the fifth image.

P1 represents the lines that create the central squares and circles. These shapes are formed when the fish (Andy) consume the food (Ant), causing blue circles to appear around them. The food (Ant) is represented by red dots in the background, while the fish (Andy) are depicted as neutral pink lines that form randomly on the screen. All these elements interact at the club (Datt23400A01 swerl1 3Final), where everything comes together.
